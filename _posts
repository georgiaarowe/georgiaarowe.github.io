This is my **first post**.

[Howdy! I am a senior Aggie from Cypress, TX. Peaches is a play on my name, Georgia, as well as an homage to my fun-self back in the days we could go outside and actually have fun. I was born and raised in Houston and named after my grandma Georgetta and grandpa George. I am obsessed with the Hobbit, and even wrote my senior thesis in high school over the book. Tolkien is such an inspirational (and relatable) human and author, as well as the other Inklings, so if you've never looked into him or that group you are missing out! I'm an English major, if you couldn't tell. While it sounds like I am a total nerd, (not sorry if you're offended by the usage of "nerd"- I am also a Scorpio.) I am actually very normal and athletic as well. I was a tennis coach for 2.5 years while I was still in high school. I have worked retail pretty much my whole life, and have been employed at Lululemon for 1.5 years now- it is the best job ever as it allows me to keep up with and pay for my active lifestyle. I am taking this class because I am in the process of obtaining my Professional Writing Certificate from Texas A&M along with my degree. It is also unlike any other English course I have taken and I feel like it will truly enrich me in any career choices I may make in the future. Very excited for the possibility of torture that technology may bring me via ENGL 460 this semester!](http://lululemon.com)
